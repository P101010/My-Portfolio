**[Body Composition Scanner](https://github.com/P101010/Body-Composition-Scanner)**  
 
- A tool to calculate body composition metrics using images, inspired by the research paper on Human proportions by Prof. John Verzani which showcased the linear relationship between body measurements such as neck to fat composition.
- Predicted neck and wrist measurements from images using a Resnet model and used a linear model to measure body composition metrics

**[Penalty Analysis and Predicion](https://medium.com/@praneithranganath10/beyond-the-kick-a-data-driven-decomposition-of-penalties-b42bfc811b03)**  
 
- Created a new dataset with paramters such as isFansSide and established thaere exists a complex realtionship between them and direction of penalty for one test player Harry Kane through EDA.
- Developed a KNN model, improved its accuracy from 44% to 89% by feature engineering, basis expansion and hyperparameter tuning
- Applied various ML tecniques and settled on distance based KNN moedel which when tuned to seven neighbours achieved an accuracy of 86%. 

**[Room Occupancy Estimation](https://github.com/P101010/Room_Occupancy_Prediction)**  

- Engineered models for a multi-class classification problem to predict the number of room occupants by building algorithms like Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and SVM using NumPy, Pandas and SciPy Optimize.
- Improved model performance by detrending time series, batch processing to reduce temporal noise, basis expansion to ensure parameters follow normal distribution.

**[Formula1 – Battle for the Drivers’ Championship Analysis and Dashboard](https://github.com/P101010/Formula-1-Drivers-Championship-Dashboard-and-Analysis)**  
 
- Extracted and integrated data from various sources and APIs, utilized **Python** for data wrangling, and created a comprehensive dashboard displaying the 2021 season insights using **Tableau**.
- Used **Exploratory Data Analysis** techniques to uncover factors influencing the 2021 championship battle.

**Health Centre Database and Datawarehouse for Analysis**  

- Designed and modeled a database to handle various aspects involved in a healthcare center.
- Created a multidimensional model with several facts such as Consultation, Tests Conducted, and Operations performed to analyze health center metrics and identify potential hazards.
- Implemented OLTP and OLAP databases using **PostgreSQL** and used **Talend Jobs** for ETL operations.

**[MBTA – Machine learning model for predicting the load on bus](https://github.com/P101010/Predicting-the-load-on-a-bus)**  
 
- Trained supervised machine learning models like **Linear Regression**, **KNN**, **Random Forest**, and **Decision Trees** using **Scikit-learn** on MBTA data to predict bus load.
- Identified **Random Forest** as the most accurate model with 82% accuracy, improving to 84.8% with further tuning of hyperparameters.

**European Football/Soccer Database Management System**  

- Architected and implemented a scalable and robust database system for the European football/soccer league using **MySQL** and **MongoDB**.
- Integrated **MySQL database** with **Python** using **SQLAlchemy** for data analysis.
